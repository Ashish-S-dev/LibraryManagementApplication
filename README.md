<h3>For testing Purpose use -></h3>

(Login as teacher) Teacher id = ST-383-2121 Username = Ashish Soni Password = Tea-12345

(Login as Student) Teacher id = ST-383-2525 Username = Ashish Soni Password = Stu-12345

(Login as Librarian) Teacher id = ST-383-2727 Username = Ashish Soni Password = Librarian@21

<b>Note:</b> This Application Sometime May Generate Delay, This is Due to Free Railway Database (MySQL). This will Definitely Resolve in Further Update.
